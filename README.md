Project Title - Analyzing one variable for Pseudo Facebook User Data

Description - The dataseet has approximately 99,000 rows or observations and 15 variables. Each observation represents a user. I performed EDA to understand what users are doing on Facebook and what they use. This isn't actual Facebook data but a complex model was used to generate it.

Parameters - The parameters used in the dataset are:
Users' birthdays
Estimating User Audience Size



The project is divided into 5 sections:

Importing the Dataset - Imported the Pseudo Facebook dataset from a CSV file to R Studio for EDA.

Exploratory Data Analysis - Visualized variables using histograms individual feature patterns. Performed faceting  Running descriptive statistical analysis on the dataset. 
Using groups and pivot tables to find the effect of categorical variables on price. Using Pearson Correlation to measure the interdependence between variables.
